# monkberry-brunch

Monkberry compiler for Brunch

## Install

```
npm install -D monkberry-brunch
```

## Configuration

You can set the `pattern` config to override the default `.monk` extension. It is the standard Brunch pattern so it can be a Regex, or glob or an array of those.

You can also specify the list of `globals` to the Monkberry compiler with a config key of that name.

## Usage

Just import your `file.monk` templates as you'd expect from the Monkberry documentation.
